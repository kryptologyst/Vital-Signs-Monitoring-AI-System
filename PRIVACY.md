# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how the Vital Signs Monitoring AI system handles data and protects user privacy.

## Data Collection and Use

### What Data We Collect

**No Personal Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected, processed, or stored by this system.**

The system only uses:
- **Synthetic data**: Artificially generated vital signs data for research purposes

- **Log data**: Technical logs for system operation and debugging

### What Data We Don't Collect

We explicitly do NOT collect:
- Real patient data
- Personal health information
- Medical records
- Biometric data from real individuals
- Any information that could identify individuals

## Data Processing

### Synthetic Data Generation

- All vital signs data is generated using mathematical models
- No real patient data is used in training or testing
- Generated data follows clinical ranges but contains no personal information

### Data Storage

- No persistent storage of user data
- Configuration files may be saved locally for user convenience
- Log files contain only technical information, no personal data

## Data Security

### Security Measures

- **No network transmission**: All processing occurs locally
- **No cloud storage**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Encrypted storage**: Any local data is stored securely
- **Access controls**: System access is limited to authorized users

### Data Retention

- **No data retention**: No personal data is retained
- **Log rotation**: Technical logs are automatically rotated
- **Cleanup procedures**: Temporary files are automatically removed

## User Rights
